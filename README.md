I'm a student at McGill University. These are links to some of my projects:

* [ePlant](https://bar.utoronto.ca/~awaesep/ePlant3) (this is a test build so it might be very buggy). This is a tool for biologists to visualize genetic data about arabidopsis, and other plants in the future. I developed it for the Bio-Analytic Resource at UofT, while supervising two volunteers. 
* [Scouting app](https://scouting-app.mm12.xyz/). @gabydd and I developed this app for members of my high school robotics team to enter data about other teams at competition. The competitions don't allow wifi, since it might interfere with the robots, so the app encodes all data in QR codes which can be scanned and entered into an excel sheet. It also works offline because it is a progressive web app.
* [Chess roguelike](https://replit.com/@alexwaese_perlman/Chess-Roguelike-1). This is a game I worked on with a team of 3 for my computer science culminating project. It is sort of a roguelike (although missing most of the features), but the characters use chess moves.
