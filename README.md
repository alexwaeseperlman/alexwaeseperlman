I'm a student at McGill University. These are links to some of my projects:

* [UPAC](https://upac.dev). This stands for University Programming Algorithm Contest. It's a platform that runs user-submitted poker bots against each other.
* [ePlant](https://bioanalyticresource.github.io/ePlant/). This is a tool for biologists to visualize genetic data about arabidopsis, and other plants in the future.
* [Chess roguelike](https://replit.com/@alexwaese_perlman/Chess-Roguelike-1). This is a game I worked on with a team of 3 for my computer science culminating project. It is sort of a roguelike (although missing most of the features), but the characters use chess moves.

You can see more by exploring my GitHub. Also, check out [this website](http:/squishy-banana.com) I build when I was 12.
